1.  Create a database for the model we built in the example. Create a SQL file that creates the tables and
inserts sample data (the questions below will help you create the data). Write queries that demonstrate the following scenarios:
-- Find a guest who exists in the database and has not booked a room.
SELECT guest.first_name, guest.last_name
FROM booking
RIGHT OUTER JOIN guest ON guest.id = booking.guest_id
WHERE booking.guest_id IS NULL;

-- Find bookings for a guest who has booked two rooms for the same dates.


-- Find bookings for a guest who has booked one room several times on different dates.
-- Count the number of unique guests who have booked the same room.

2.  Design a data model for students and the classes they have taken. The model should include the students' grades for a given class.
-- Work through the questions from the example above.
-- Document any assumptions you make about what data should be stored, what data types should be used, etc., and include them in a text file.
-- Ask questions of your mentor if you are unsure about parts of your model.
-- Draw the model using the notation used in the checkpoint and submit a picture. You can also use a tool like StarUML or
quickdatabasediagrams.com if you choose.

3.  Build a database for the students/classes data model. Create a SQL file that creates the tables and inserts
sample data (the questions below will help you create the data). Write queries that demonstrate the following scenarios:
-- Find all students who have taken a particular class.
-- Count the number of each grade (using letter grades A-F) earned in a particular class.
-- Find class names and the total number of students who have taken each class in the list.
-- Find the class taken by the largest number of students.
