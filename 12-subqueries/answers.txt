1. Explain a subquery in your own words.
A subquery is basically a query inside of a query.  It can be used in different ways to
query a subset of data.

2. Where can you use a subquery within a SELECT statement?
It can be used in the SELECT, FROM, or WHERE clauses.

3. When would you employ a subquery?
A subquery is typically used when data from two or more tables needs to joined and requires
some sort of filter or conditional.

4. Explain a row constructor in your own words.
A row constructor creates a row using specified values for each column in the table.

5. What happens if a row in the subquery result provides a NULL value to the comparison?
The result of the comparison is NULL.

6. What are the ways to use a subquery within a WHERE clause? If you can't remember them, do these flashcards until you can.
Several ways:  IN, NOT IN, ANY/SOME, ALL, EXISTS, NOT EXISTS

9. Using this Library schema and data, write queries applying the following scenarios:
- To determine if the library should buy more copies of a given book, please provide the names and position, in order, of all
of the patrons with a hold (request for a book with all copies checked out) on "Advanced Potion-Making".
SELECT patrons.name, holds.rank
FROM holds
JOIN patrons ON patrons.id = holds.patron_id
WHERE isbn IN
  (SELECT isbn
   FROM books
   WHERE title = 'Advanced Potion-Making')
ORDER BY holds.rank

name	rank
Terry Boot	1
Cedric Diggory	2

- Make a list of all book titles and denote whether or not a copy of that book is checked out.
SELECT Books.title, 'Checked Out' as is_checked_out
FROM
  (SELECT isbn
  FROM transactions
  WHERE checked_in_date IS NULL) AS t
JOIN Books ON Books.isbn = t.isbn
UNION
SELECT Books.title, 'Not Checked Out' as is_checked_out
FROM
  (SELECT isbn
   FROM transactions
   WHERE isbn NOT IN
    (SELECT isbn
    FROM transactions
    WHERE checked_in_date IS NULL)) as p
JOIN Books ON Books.isbn = p.isbn

title	                                    is_checked_out
Hogwarts: A History	Not                   Checked Out
Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them	  Checked Out
Advanced Potion-Making	                  Checked Out

- In an effort to learn which books take longer to read, the librarians would like you to create a list of total checked out
time by book name in the past month.



- In order to learn which items should be retired, make a list of all books that have not been checked out in the past 5 years.

- List all of the library patrons. If they have one or more books checked out, correspond the books to the patrons.


10. Using this Flight schema and data, write queries applying the following scenarios:
- To determine the most profitable airplanes, find all airplane models where each flight has had over 250 paying customers in the past month.
- To determine the most profitable flights, find all destination-origin pairs where 90% or more of the seats have been sold in the past month.
- The airline is looking to expand its presence in Asia and globally. Find the total revenue of any flight (not time restricted)
arriving at or departing from Singapore (SIN).

11. Compare the subqueries you've written above. Compare them to the joins you wrote in Checkpoint 6. Which ones are more readable?
Which were more logical to write?
