2. Explain in your own words when a database might be used. Explain when a text file might be used.

A database would be used when data needs to be saved, retrieved, and/or changed regularly.  It also would be used
when a large amount of data needs to be manipulated.  A text file might be used when information won't need to be changed
or specific data retrieved, such as a log file.

3. Describe one difference between SQL and other programming languages.
SQL is declarative, which means it needs to be written in a form that defines WHAT data is needed,
instead of HOW to get the data like in other languages.

4. In your own words, explain how the pieces of a database system fit together at a high level.
A database system allows data to be saved, retrieved or changed in an easy way even an application that
might interact with the data is not running.  The system includes the main database that stores the data, and sometimes
is run on a server so that data can be accessed remotely, such as through the internet.

5. Explain the meaning of table, row, column, and value.
The table is the entire unit that holds the data.  The table is split up into columns (splits the table vertically)
and rows (splits the table horizontally).  A value is a specific piece of data at a particular column and row location.
