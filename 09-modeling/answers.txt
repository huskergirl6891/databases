1.  Create a database for the model we built in the example. Create a SQL file that creates the tables and
inserts sample data (the questions below will help you create the data). Write queries that demonstrate the following scenarios:
-- Find a guest who exists in the database and has not booked a room.
SELECT guest.first_name, guest.last_name
FROM booking
RIGHT OUTER JOIN guest ON guest.id = booking.guest_id
WHERE booking.guest_id IS NULL;

-- Find bookings for a guest who has booked two rooms for the same dates.
SELECT guest.first_name, guest.last_name, multiple_rooms.check_in_date, multiple_rooms.check_out_date, multiple_rooms.number_of_rooms
FROM guest
JOIN
(SELECT check_in_date, check_out_date, guest_id, COUNT(guest_id) AS number_of_rooms
FROM booking
GROUP BY check_in_date, check_out_date, guest_id
HAVING COUNT(guest_id) > 1) AS multiple_rooms
ON guest.id = multiple_rooms.guest_id

-- Find bookings for a guest who has booked one room several times on different dates.
SELECT guest.first_name, guest.last_name, multiple_stays.room_id, multiple_stays.number_of_stays
FROM guest
JOIN
(SELECT guest_id, room_id, COUNT(room_id) AS number_of_stays
FROM booking
GROUP BY room_id, guest_id
HAVING COUNT(room_id) > 1) AS multiple_stays
ON guest.id = multiple_stays.guest_id

-- Count the number of unique guests who have booked the same room.
SELECT room.room_number, room.floor_number, uniq_counts.guest_count
FROM room
JOIN
(SELECT room_id, COUNT (DISTINCT guest_id) AS guest_count
FROM booking
GROUP BY room_id) as uniq_counts
ON room.id = uniq_counts.room_id;


2.  Design a data model for students and the classes they have taken. The model should include the students' grades for a given class.
-- Work through the questions from the example above.
-- Document any assumptions you make about what data should be stored, what data types should be used, etc., and include them in a text file.
What classes/entities to model?
- Need to store info about students and classes, and each student's grade for each class.
Other assumptions:
- Many students can be in one class
- One student can have one grade per class
- One student can be in many classes
-- Ask questions of your mentor if you are unsure about parts of your model.
-- Draw the model using the notation used in the checkpoint and submit a picture. You can also use a tool like StarUML or
quickdatabasediagrams.com if you choose.

Student
-
StudentID PK int

Class
-
ClassID PK int
Name string
Teacher string

Grades
----
GradesID PK int
ClassID int FK >- Class.ClassID
StudentID int FK >- Student.StudentID
Grade string


3.  Build a database for the students/classes data model. Create a SQL file that creates the tables and inserts
sample data (the questions below will help you create the data). Write queries that demonstrate the following scenarios:
-- Find all students who have taken a particular class.
SELECT student.name, class.name
FROM grade
JOIN student ON student.student_id = grade.student_id
JOIN class ON class.class_id = grade.class_id
WHERE class.name = 'Math';

-- Count the number of each grade (using letter grades A-F) earned in a particular class.
SELECT class_id, COUNT (DISTINCT grade)
FROM grade
GROUP BY class_id;

-- Find class names and the total number of students who have taken each class in the list.
SELECT class_id, COUNT (DISTINCT student_id)
FROM grade
GROUP BY class_id;

-- Find the class taken by the largest number of students.
SELECT class.name, max_class.student_count
FROM class
JOIN
(SELECT class_id, COUNT(student_id) AS student_count
FROM grade
GROUP BY class_id) AS max_class
ON class.class_id = max_class.class_id
ORDER BY max_class.student_count DESC
LIMIT 1
